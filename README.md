Plan is to create a game creator supporting map application, where missions/ game locations/flags or similar can be placed in a real map in the real world to be located at. Each locations purpose on the game is decided by the creator that is using the application.

Our project plans to supply the tools of detailing all kinds of information that the game master would like to add to the game locations and various ways to distinguish the game locations from each other. Scale of the project is still open so the feature set is not bound to any set of strict features, but the basic adding of locations, removing locations and moving locations would be ideal as well as separating “game maps” from each others.

The most well known example of this kind of real world game board game is The Amazing Race. This application should support similar games.
